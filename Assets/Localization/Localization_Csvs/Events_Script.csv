Events_Script.Onboarding.1.1,,Robot,Hello {playername}! It seems as though your fledgling cryptocurrency empire is really taking off!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.1.2,,Robot,"The coin that you’ve created has become one of the hottest investments on the market, and your wealth is quickly growing.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.1.3,,Robot,"I am the Occasionally Serviceable Cryptocurrency Acquisition Robot, but you can call me {robot}",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.1.4,,Robot,I was produced by the company of a friendly businessman to help up-and-coming crypto billionaires like yourself manage your operations. ,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.1.5,,Robot,My creator actually stops by around here from time to time. I can’t wait for you to meet him!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.1.6,,Robot,"Anyway, my protocol dictates that I must ask for the name of your cryptocurrency before I begin operations.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.2.1,,Robot,"{coinname}, huh? That’s got a nice ring to it. We’re going to take this coin to the top of the charts!",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.2.2,,Robot,Let me show you around!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.2.3,,Robot,This is your home base. You can use your computer to trade {coinname} for other cryptocurrencies.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.3.1,,Robot,You can also do some online shopping with your computer. I understand this is a favorite pastime for you humans.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.3.2,,Robot,I will handle all the record keeping of your business. You can check those in the bookshelf.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.3.3,,Robot,"If you want to see how you’re doing, you can always peruse the records there. ",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.3.4,,Robot,"If you need me to implement any new directives, you can make a note in the records and I will get right to it. ",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.4.1,,Robot,"As you know, cryptocurrency is created through mining.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.4.2,,Robot,Since I’ve joined your team I’ve made a some great improvements to your {coinname} mining capabilities.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.4.3,,Robot,Let’s go check them out!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.4.4,,Robot,You can navigate by swiping left or right. Try swiping to the left to go check out the mines!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.5.1,,Robot,My user’s manual suggests that you can execute a swipe by dragging your finger from the left to right side of the screen.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.6.1,,Robot,Here we are. The mines. This is where you can usually find me hard at work mining {coinname}…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.6.2,,Robot,… or just resting my circuits from time to time.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.6.3,,Robot,"This is your minecart. I will fill it up with the coins I mine until it is full, then you can come by and collect them.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.7.1,,Robot,It looks like the minecart is full now. You might as well collect those coins while we’re here.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.8.1,,Robot,Go ahead. Just tap on the minecart and collect the coins. I worked hard filling that thing up!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.9.1,,Robot,We just made our first 100 {coinname} together! I shall mark this occasion in my data logs for future auditing purposes.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.9.2,,Robot,"If you wish, I will also allow you to join me in the mineshaft, where I solve puzzles to extract the {coinname}.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.9.3,,Robot,All you need to do is tap the mineshaft.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.10.1,,Robot,"I can only do that from time to time, though. I need to recharge my lithium ion batteries afterwards.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.10.2,,Robot,"Mining is hard work, buddy.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.10.3,,Robot,You can tap on me to spend your coins on upgrades for the minecart and the mineshaft that will allow me to mine even more efficiently!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.11.1,,Robot,Any good entrepreneur knows you need to spend money to make money. Invest wisely and you’ll be raking in the coins in no time!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.11.2,,Robot,Now let’s head back to base. I have someone for you to meet.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.12.1,,Robot,Just drag your finger from the right to the left side of the screen to swipe. Remember?,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.1,,Dog,"{robot}! Long time no see! How are you getting along with your new employer, {playername}?",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.2,,Robot,{dog}! I haven’t seen you since I left your factory. Things are going swimmingly. I was just showing {playername} around their facilities.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.3,,Robot,"{playername}, this is {dog}. He is the inventor of autonomous humanoid crypto-mining robots.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.4,,Robot,"This, along with a number of other ventures has made him one of the wealthiest dogs on Earth…",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.5,,Robot,"and as you may have gathered, he is my creator. How it warms my capacitors to see him again!",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.6,,Dog,"Now now {robot}, there’s no need to talk me up like that.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.7,,Dog,I’m not some kibble-and-caviar kind of pup.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.8,,Dog,"I’m much more down to hang out, bark at squirrels, maybe check out a few sick memes online. Ya know, Such Wow.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.9,,Dog,"Well now that I’ve made it here {robot}, I need to ask you a question… ",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.10,,Dog,Have you seen my updog? I’ve been looking for it everywhere.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.11,,Robot,That does not compute sir. What is updog?,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.12,,Dog,Nothing much homie!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.13,,Dog,I really gotta upgrade the humor components on these things.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.14,,Dog,Actually I came to see you {playername}. I need your help.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.15,,Dog,In my spare time I like to dabble in some space travel.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.16,,Dog,It’s a bit of a passion project for me.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.17,,Dog,I want to expand dogmanity out to the stars!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.18,,Dog,But it seems I now have some competition.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.19,,Dog,{stonks} has built his own rocket and is already on the moon!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.20,,Robot,{stonks}? Isn’t that the guy who made all that money trading stocks in internet companies?,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.21,,Dog,Yes! And he thinks stocks are better than crypto! Get with the times man!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.22,,Dog,Unfortunately I’ve been too busy with my other companies to keep up with him.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.23,,Dog,"{playername}, after watching how you’ve built up {coinname}, I think you’re the one for this job…",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.24,,Dog,"I am gifting you some of my rocketry resources, so you can check out what {stonks} is doing up there.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.25,,Dog,We haven’t quite worked out the technology to make it to the moon yet.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.26,,Dog,"I’m just too busy right now, and I figured with all the {coinname} you’re amassing, you could fund the expedition.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.27,,Robot,So {playername} needs to take…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.28,,Dog,{coinname} TO THE MOOooOON!!!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.29,,Robot,Oh brother…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.30,,Dog,"{robot}, you’ve been around my rocket facility, right? Why don’t you show {playername} the ropes. I’ll be back to check on you two later.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.31,,Dog,I’ll be back to check on you two later.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.32,,Robot,Right away sir!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.33,,Dog,"{robot}, stop calling me sir!",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.34,,Dog,"{playername}, I trust you’ll be on the moon in no time. Back to business for me… bye now!",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.35,,Robot,Yes sir!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.36,,Robot,… So…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.37,,Robot,… {playername}…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.13.38,,Robot,Let’s head over to your new rocket facility.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.14.1,,Robot,Don’t you know the drill by now? Drag your finger from the right side of the screen to the left side of the screen to swipe.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.14.2,,Robot,You humans truly perplex me sometimes.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.1,,Robot,Oh my…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.2,,Robot,Look at that rust bucket of a rocket.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.3,,Robot,My calculations do not predict a high probability of you making it to the moon in that thing.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.4,,Robot,"I feel it deep in my software that you can do it, though.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.5,,Robot,I learned a few things about the operations of this place while working alongside {dog}.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.15.6,,Robot,This is your rocket lab.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.1,,Robot,This is where you can spend your {coinname} to conduct experiments on your rocket.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.2,,Robot,You’ve got a couple employees to assign to various research projects.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.3,,Robot,"When an employee finishes their research, you can collect the knowledge they’ve gained.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.4,,Robot,This knowledge will increase the thrust of the rocket.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.5,,Robot,"The more thrust we have, the higher we can go…",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.6,,Robot,… so we’re going to need a lot of thrust.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.7,,Robot,{dog} was always talking about these things called {gemname_plural}.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.8,,Robot,He said that he had some secret experiments prepared that required them.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.9,,Robot,Apparently you can only find {gemname_plural} in the void of space.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.10,,Robot,"So if you see a {gemname_singular} out there, pick it up so we can run those experiments!",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.11,,Robot,Speaking of going up there…,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.12,,Robot,"To launch your rocket, just open the lid, and press the launch button.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.16.13,,Robot,You can open the lid by swiping up on it.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.17.1,,Robot,Just drag your finger from the bottom to the top of the button to open the lid.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.18.1,,Robot,Wait!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.18.2,,Robot,Don’t press it yet!!!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.18.3,,Robot,I don’t need you flying off. Close that thing so we can head back to base.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.19.1,,Robot,Are you still there?,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.19.2,,Robot,Drag your finger from the top to the bottom of the lid to close it.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.20.1,,Robot,"I can complete 500,000,000 calculations per second, but take your time {playername}.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.20.2,,Robot,"Whenever you are ready, drag your finger from the left to the right side of the screen to swipe us back to base.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.1,,Robot,You’ve just about seen it all.,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.2,,Robot,"Remember that I, and the rest of your employees will be hard at work even when you’re sleeping.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.3,,Robot,"In fact, most things will have timers next to them showing when they are ready for use.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.4,,Robot,Be on the lookout for those!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.5,,Robot,"Things will be much more efficient around here with your guidance, however.",,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.6,,Robot,Be sure to check in often!,,,
Events_Script.Onboarding.21.7,,Robot,"Good luck, {playername}!",,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.1,,Dog,{playername}! You really did it! I had all the faith that you could make it to the moon!,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.2,,Dog,"Unfortunately, I wasn’t expecting you to make it there so fast.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.3,,Dog,"I’m working as quickly as possible to get a moon base set up, so you can continue your operations there.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.4,,Dog,"It isn’t quite ready yet, though.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.5,,Dog,"In the meantime, why don’t you keep upgrading your rocket and collecting resources?",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.1.6,,Dog,We might need them if we plan on figuring out what {stonks} is up to….,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.1,,Guy,Waaaaaah!! Did I hear someone speak my name?,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.2,,Guy,{dog}!,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.3,,Guy,It’s been too long. I haven’t seen you since the billionaire’s conference in Saint-Tropez.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.4,,Dog,{stonks}!,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.5,,Dog,What kind of dastardly plans are you harboring? Why are you on the moon?,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.6,,Guy,"Now now, {dog}, let’s not be too presumptuous.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.7,,Guy,You’ll just have to get in your rocket and come meet me up there.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.8,,Guy,Oh wait… I nearly forgot…,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.9,,Guy,You don’t have any rockets that can make it to the moon!,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.10,,Dog,That may be so… but {playername} does.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.11,,Guy,Oh really? And who is this {playername} might I ask?,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.12,,Dog,They’re only the next crypto billionaire in the making…,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.13,,Dog,and they’re going to stop you from doing whatever you’re up to.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.14,,Guy,You don’t say? Well…,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.15,,Guy,It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance {playername}.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.16,,Guy,I look forward to your visit.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.17,,Guy,Until then I need to get back to counting my huge piles of MONEY!,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.18,,Guy,"Until next time, {dog} and {playername}.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.19,,Dog,Ugh literal piles of money? Doesn’t he know everything is digital now?,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.20,,Robot,I may need to recalibrate my sensors but I did not get a good vibe from that guy.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.21,,Dog,Yeah he’s a total creep… stuck in 1999.,,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.22,,Dog,"{playername}, you keep working on that rocket. I’m gonna get your moonbase ready.",,,
Events_Script.NextLevelNotReady.Earth.2.23,,Dog,Let’s show {stonks} the power of crypto!,,,
